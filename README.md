Some scripts shell and aliases to keep your life easy and fun.

## lastModif

USage : `lastModif`

Show last ten files modified by date order from most recent to the least.

## npm-init

Usage `npm-init [optionnal]`

Use npm to init the repository and add some scripts in package.json for automation purposes.

It setups Babel, Parcel, SASS allowing you to work with what you want.

It accept two parameters : `git` and `react`

First does only `git init`

Second is more useful because it setups your working directory to use ReactJs without create a whole React application (Yes you can do it ðŸ˜Ž See my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/LeFodeurCou/pen/XWMOjjX) to learn how it works).

Scripts injected in package.json are npm cross-plateforme packages :)
I know, this script is only for Linux bash users :trollface:

## vhostCreate

Usage : `vhostCreate vhostName [optionnal]`

Exemples : `vhostCreate test` / `vhostCreate demo dev`

Creates respectively test.local and demo.dev.local virtual hosts for apache server. It creates configurations files, adds a line in /etc/hosts to match the vhost with your localhost and creates a specific folder in ~/dev.

Why in ~/dev and not in /var/www/html/ ? 

Because I have a symbolic link for ~/dev folder in /var/www/html/ ðŸ™ƒ It works well and so you can work where you want ðŸŽ‰
